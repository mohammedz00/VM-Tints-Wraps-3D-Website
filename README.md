# VM-Tints-Wraps-3D-Website
3D Website created for a local car detailing business created using ReactJS and ThreeJS

This website was created for a local business in the car detailing industry. They asked for the inclusion of 3D models, animations and colour pickers (things which I have never incorporated into a website). Through studying of many different resources the website was created and received excellent feedback from the business owners. The design for the website was inspired by the ThreeJS video from JavaScript Mastery. I have learned a lot from this project and hope to increase my skillset and create better and better websites for other businesses.
